# What Is Data Science?

## Three Things

Content knowledge (Science)

Statistics (Math -- Weird math, but still math)

Computer Skills (Technology/Computer Engineering)

## Statistics

Statistics is a very complex field.

- That does not mean it has to be complicated!

We have two goals in statistics:

> Explain

> Predict


## Explain

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price, color = cut)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  facet_grid(~ cut) +
  scale_color_few() +
  theme_few()
```


## Predict

```{r}
ggplot(mpg[mpg$cyl != 5, ], aes(cty, displ, color = as.factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(alpha = .25) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, size = 2) +
  theme_few()
```


## Computer Science Skills

This is probably the hardest to define.

Computer Science is basically knowing how to really use a computer.

Start simple -- try not using a mouse for a day.

## Content Knowledge

This can be anything that interests you!

You just need to know the scientific process!

## The Key

# What Does A Data Scientist Do?

## Solve Problems

Find and arrange data -- essentially a huge puzzle.

- Especially from the web.

## Find Relationships

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=9, fig.align="center"}
library(DT); library(broom); library(dplyr)

carCor = cor(mtcars)

carCor = as.data.frame(carCor) %>% 
  mutate(item = row.names(carCor)) %>% 
  tidyr::gather(key = key, value = corrVal, -item)

ggplot(carCor, aes(item, key, fill = corrVal)) +
  geom_raster(interpolate = TRUE) +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev(levels(as.factor(carCor$key)))) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#3d52a1", mid = "#ffffff", high = "#ae1c3e") +
  theme_few()

```

# How To Become A Data Scientist!

## Learn How To Write Code

Start small and with purpose!

> Batch scripts

> Regular Expressions

> Cascading Style Sheets

> Javascript


## Getting Domain Knowledge

The beauty of data science lies in its flexibility.

A strong research background, coupled with CS skills, will give you everything you need.

## Learn As Much About Statistics As Possible

Always start at regression.

- It is the foundation for most statistics.


## What Can Data Scientists Do? 

Anything!

Work in industry, academia, private consulting, healthcare, military, and just about any other job type.
