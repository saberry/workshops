## base & stats

You could get by only using the <span class="pack">base</span> and <span class="pack">stats</span> packages.

They are both powerful enough to do practically anything that you would ever need to do.

## The Downside

$Power + Flexibility = Complexity$

This was a common line for subsetting data:

```{r}
mtcars[which(mtcars$mpg >= mean(mtcars$mpg) & mtcars$cyl == 6), ]
```


## Subsetting Variables

```{r, eval = FALSE}
varList = c("country", 
            paste("iso", 2:3, sep = ""),
            grep(".*sp.*", colnames(who), value = TRUE))

newDat = who[, colnames(who) %in% varList]
```



## The Present

The <span class="pack">base</span> approach is not intuitive.

That is where <span class="pack">dplyr</span> enters the arena.

It is arguably one of the most popular R packages.


## The Grammar Of Data Manipulation

Intuitive names are the first improvement:

<p>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">arrange</span>|</span>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">between</span>|</span>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">coalesce</span>|</span>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">distinct</span>|</span>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">filter</span>|</span>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">group_by</span>|</span>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">left_join</span>|</span>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">mutate</span>|</span>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">select</span>|</span>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">summarize</span>|</span>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">tally</span>|</span>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">top_n</span></span>
<p>

<p class="fragment fade-up">Just given the function names, we can probably guess what each of these do.</p>

## Translating Old To New

From this:

```{r}
mtcars[which(mtcars$mpg >= mean(mtcars$mpg) & mtcars$cyl == 6), ]
```


To this:

```{r}
filter(mtcars, mpg >= mean(mpg) & cyl == 6)
```

## Wrangling Made Easy

```{r, eval = FALSE}
varList = c("country", 
            paste("iso", 2:3, sep = ""),
            grep(".*sp.*", colnames(who), 
                 value = TRUE))

newDat = who[, colnames(who) %in% varList]
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(who, country, num_range("iso", 2:3), contains("sp"))
```


## SQL-like Joins

<span class="pack">dplyr</span> also provides several different joins.

<span class="func">left_join</span> -- x rows and all columns

<span class="func">right_join</span> -- y rows and all columns

<span class="func">inner_join</span> -- all matching rows and all columns 

<span class="func">full_join</span> -- all rows and all columns

<span class="func">anti_join</span> -- return x rows where there are no y matches 

## Joining Data

```{r}
df1 = data.frame(ticks = c("AAPL", "A", "BFG"), 
                 revenue = c(10, 30, 50))

df2 = data.frame(tick = c("AAPL", "A", "N"), 
                 expends = c(5, 15, 25))

inner_join(df1, df2, by = c("ticks" = "tick"))
```


## tidyr

Reshaping data can be a perilous excursion.

Plotting functions and many analyses need long data.

R has packages for reshaping (e.g., <span class="pack">reshape2</span>).

As good as those are, <span class="pack">tidyr</span> makes reshaping too easy.

It also has very clear functions:

<span class="func">gather</span>, <span class="func">spread</span>, <span class="func">unite</span>, <span class="func">separate</span>


## Wide To Long

```{r}
head(gather(mtcars, key = variable, value = value))
```


## Wide To Long -- Grouped

```{r}
head(gather(mtcars, key = variable, value = value, -cyl))
```

## Separate Columns

```{r}
(df = data.frame(executiveName = c("Jon Crutchfield", "Father Mark", "Roger Huang")))
```

```{r}
separate(df, executiveName, c("firstName", "lastName"))
```



## magrittr

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg)

> The famous pipe. How people reproached me for it! And yet, could you stuff my pipe? No, it's just a representation, is it not? So if I had written on my picture 'This is a pipe', I'd have been lying!

## Pipes

The <span class="pack">magrittr</span> package contains a number of different pipes.

<p>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">%$%</span>|</span>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">%\<\>%</span>|</span>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">%\>%</span>|</span>
<span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">%T\>%</span></span>
<p>

>- The most popular one is likely <span class="func">%\>%</span>.

>- It is functionally equivalent to the Unix <span class="func">|</span>

## Aliases

R has some mysterious functions.

<span class="pack">magrittr</span> gives names to some of these rather archiac functions.

<span class="func">\`[[\`</span> = <span class="fragment fade-up"><span class="func">extract2</span></span>


## Action Sequence

```{r}
`[[`(mtcars, 1)
```

```{r}
extract2(mtcars, 1)
```


## Can't Stop The Flow

Using these three packages together gives us ultimate power.

We can pipe functions together until we get what we need.

- You can also pipe to other functions (e.g., <span class="func">lm</span>).

## Days Of Yore

I want years greater than 2000, only columns with "sn", averaged by country, and taken from wide to long.

```{r}

who1 = who[who$year > 2000, grep("country|.*sn.*", colnames(who))]

who1 = na.omit(who1)

colList = list(grep("*sn.*", colnames(who1), value = TRUE))

res = lapply(colList, 
             function(x) aggregate(who1[x], by = list(who1$country), FUN = mean))
```

## And It Don't Stop...

```{r}

res = as.data.frame(res)

row.names(res) = res$Group.1

res$Group.1 = NULL

res = reshape(res, idvar = "country", ids = row.names(res), 
              times = names(res), timevar = "var",
              varying = list(1:14), 
              direction = "long")

head(res)
```


## There Has To Be A Better Way

```{r}

who1 = who %>% 
  filter(year > 2000) %>%
  select(country, contains("sn")) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize_all(funs(mean(., na.rm = TRUE))) %>% 
  gather(key = variable, value = value, -country)

head(who1)

```


## data.table

The <span class="pack">data.table</span> package is a pretty far departure from <span class="pack">dplyr</span>.

Everything works with *i*, *j*, *k* indexing.

$$data.table(i, j, k) = data.table[which, what, by]$$

While <span class="pack">dplyr</span> is clear and concise, <span class="pack">data.table</span> is slightly confusing.

What it lacks in elegance, it makes up for in speed!

## That Is Fast


```{r}
whoDT = data.table(who, key = "country")

dtTest = whoDT[, mean(new_sp_m014, na.rm = TRUE), by = country]
```


```{r}
dplyrTest = who %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(mean(new_sp_m014, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(who %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(mean(new_sp_m014, na.rm = TRUE)), 
  whoDT[, mean(new_sp_m014, na.rm = TRUE), by = country], 
  unit = "s", times = 500)
```

## Convenience Functions

There are a few different convenience functions within <span class="pack">data.table</span>.

These two are incredibly helpful.

<span class="func">.I</span> = seq_len(nrow(x))

<span class="func">.GRP</span> = group counter


## Chaining Indices

Just like the pipes we previously saw, <span class="pack">data.table</span> lets us continuously chain statements together.

```{r}
whoDT[, mean(new_sp_m014, na.rm = TRUE), by = country][, log(V1), by = country]
```

It can get ugly (and fast)!

## A Real Example

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mrktingName = mrktingName[, c("Ticker.Symbol", "Fiscal.Year",
                              "howLongPerson", "personID") :=
                            list(Ticker.Symbol, Fiscal.Year,
                                 seq(.N), .GRP),
                          by = list(name)]
[, numSeq := seq(min(Fiscal.Year), 
                 max(Fiscal.Year)), by = list(personID)]
[, runningTotal := ifelse(Fiscal.Year == numSeq, seq(.N), 1L), 
by = list(Ticker.Symbol, personID)]
```


## What Do R And Neapolitan Ice Cream Have In Common?

<p class="fragment fade-up">
You can enjoy all flavors at once!
</p>


## And It Is Just As Tasty...

```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.height=4}
who %>% 
  select(country, contains("sp")) %>% 
  data.table(key = "country") %>% 
  .[, c("epM25Mean", "epF25Mean") := 
      list(mean(new_sp_m2534, na.rm = TRUE), mean(new_sp_f2534, na.rm = TRUE)), 
    by = country] %>% 
  filter(epM25Mean > 0 & epF25Mean > 0) %>%
  .[, plot(.$epM25Mean, .$epF25Mean)]
```

## stringr

<span class="pack">stringr</span> eases string pain.

Unless you have a need to use regex regularly, it can be tricky.

<span class="pack">stringr</span> has a variety of functions to replace <span class="func">grep</span> and <span class="func">gsub</span>.

## Audience Participation Time!

What would the following line do?

<p class="fragment fade-up">
^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$
</p>


## Trimming Strings

```{r}

x = " Happy Halloween!   "

gsub("^\\s+|\\s+$", "", x)

```

```{r}
str_trim(x)
```

## Counting Characters

```{r}
people = c("Seth Berry", "George Jiang", NA, "Andres Martinez")
```

```{r}
nchar(people)
```

```{r}
str_count(people)
```
